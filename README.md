As an undergraduate Computer Science student with a strong foundation in DSA, C, C++, Java, and full-stack development, I'm deeply passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology. My curiosity drives me to explore the intersection of AI, robotics, and blockchain, where I believe the most exciting innovations are yet to come. I aim to be at the forefront of these transformations, leveraging my skills to contribute to the tech landscape.

Collaboration and problem-solving are at the core of my approach to learning and development. Whether I'm working on a team project, tackling a coding challenge, or building a full-stack application, I'm always eager to push boundaries and create solutions that make a difference.

When Iâ€™m not coding or diving into new technologies, you can find me on the cricket field. The game has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseveranceâ€”qualities that I bring into every aspect of my life.

Iâ€™m always on the lookout for opportunities to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, collaborate on innovative projects, and explore new challenges. If you share similar interests or need a passionate and dedicated collaborator, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
